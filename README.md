This is the source code for the TelegramBot I built using ChatGPT and Dall-E APIs.

Bot's main functionalities:
1. Everyday bot gives users 10 new attempts to use for either image or text generation via OpenAI services.
2. Users can get more attempts by inviting new users using their unique referral links.
3. For every referral, user will get 5 more attempts.
4. Users can use their attempts for either image or text generation.
5. Bot supports 3 languages: Uzbek, Russian and English and it will adopt to the Telegram App's main language. 
   If users main language is different, English will be set as a default language
